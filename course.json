Students Table\nThis table stores information about the students.\nTable Definition:\n\nstudent_id: Unique identifier for each student (Primary Key).\nname: Name of the student.\nemail: Contact email (must be unique).\nmajor: The student’s field of study.\n\nSQL Statement:\nCREATE TABLE students (\n    student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    major TEXT NOT NULL\n);\n\nExplanation:\n\nPrimary Key: student_id ensures each student is uniquely identified.\n\n\n2. Professors Table\nThis table stores information about the professors.\nTable Definition:\n\nprofessor_id: Unique identifier for each professor (Primary Key).\nname: Name of the professor.\nemail: Contact email (must be unique).\ndepartment: The professor’s department.\n\nSQL Statement:\nCREATE TABLE professors (\n    professor_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    department TEXT NOT NULL\n);\n\nExplanation:\n\nPrimary Key: professor_id ensures each professor is uniquely identified.\n\n\n3. Courses Table\nThis table stores information about the courses offered at the university.\nTable Definition:\n\ncourse_id: Unique identifier for each course (Primary Key).\nname: Name of the course.\ncredits: Number of credits the course is worth.\nprofessor_id: References the professor teaching the course (Foreign Key).\n\nSQL Statement:\nCREATE TABLE courses (\n    course_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    credits INT NOT NULL,\n    professor_id INT REFERENCES professors(professor_id)\n);\n\nExplanation:\n\nPrimary Key: course_id uniquely identifies each course.\nForeign Key: professor_id establishes a relationship with the professors table to associate each course with a professor.\n\n\n4. Enrollments Table\nThis table tracks which students are enrolled in which courses.\nTable Definition:\n\nenrollment_id: Unique identifier for each enrollment (Primary Key).\nstudent_id: References the student enrolled (Foreign Key).\ncourse_id: References the course the student is enrolled in (Foreign Key).\n\nSQL Statement:\nCREATE TABLE enrollments (\n    enrollment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    student_id INT REFERENCES students(student_id),\n    course_id INT REFERENCES courses(course_id)\n);\n\nExplanation:\n\nPrimary Key: enrollment_id uniquely identifies each enrollment.\nForeign Keys:\n\nstudent_id links to the students table to associate an enrollment with a student.\ncourse_id links to the courses table to associate an enrollment with a course.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: DML Operations\nPerform the following operations in SQL:\n1. Add 5 Students\n \n2. Add 3 Professors\n\n \n3. Add 5 Courses\n\n \n4. Enroll 5 Students in Courses\n\n \n5. Retrieve All Students\n\n \n6. Retrieve All Courses Taught by Dr. Smith\n\n \n7. Update a Student’s Major\n\n \n8. Delete a Course\n\n \n9. Retrieve All Enrollments for a Specific Course\n\n \n10. Delete a Student and Their Enrollments\n\n\n\nSubmission\n\nShow the results of your SELECT queries.\nEnsure all tables are created with proper primary and foreign keys.\nSubmit your SQL script and screenshots of the results.\n\n\nWrap-Up\nThis laboratory has guided you through creating tables with relationships using foreign keys and performing various DML operations. Understanding these concepts is fundamental to managing relational databases effectively."

Test API Endpoints\n\nUse Postman, Thunder Client (VS Code extension) to test:\nEnsure routes return correct responses and HTTP status codes.\n\n\nSubmission Requirements\nStudents must submit:\n\nGitHub repository URL containing:\n\nImplemented controllers inside controllers/.\nDefined API routes inside routes/.\nUpdated index.js with the correct route setup.\n\n\nScreenshots of API tests using Postman or Thunder Client, showing:\n\nSuccessful user registration.\nSuccessful login response with a token.\n\n\n\n\nGrading Criteria\n\n\n\nCriteria\nWeightage\n\n\n\n\nControllers implemented correctly\n30%\n\n\nRoutes properly defined & connected\n30%\n\n\nAPI tests completed & documented\n30%\n\n\nCode readability & structure\n10%"

Install JSON Web Token (JWT)\nRun the following command inside your backend project:\nnpm install jsonwebtoken\n\n\n2. Add JWT Secret Key to .env\n\nOpen the .env file in the backend project.\nAdd the same KEY_SECRET variable for encrypting and validating tokens:\n\nKEY_SECRET=your_secret_key_here\n\n\n3. Implement JWT Middleware\n\nImplement the token validation middleware.\n\nExample: tokenValidation in your index.js\n\n\nconst tokenValidation = (req, res, next) => {\n    const authorization = req.headers['authorization'];\n    if (!authorization) {\n        return res.status(400).json({ message: \"You need to pass a Token\" });\n    }\n\n    const token = authorization.replace('Bearer ', '').trim();\n\n    try {\n        const secret = process.env.KEY_SECRET;\n        jwt.verify(token, secret);\n        next();\n    } catch (err) {\n        return res.status(400).json({ message: \"Invalid Token\" });\n    }\n};\n\n\n\n\n4. Secure Routes Using the Middleware\n\nApply the middleware to protect specific routes.\n\nExample: Applying Middleware in Routes\n\n\n\n5. Test API Endpoints with JWT Authentication\n\nUse Postman or Thunder Client to:\n\nAuthenticate by sending a login request and receiving a token.\nUse that token to access protected routes.\nTry making requests without a token and with an invalid token to verify security.\n\n\n\nExample headers for authentication:\nAuthorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here\n\n\n6. Deploy the Backend on Render\n\nDeploy your backend on Render following these steps:\n\nPush your backend project to a public GitHub repository.\nGo to Render and create a new web service.\nConnect the repository and choose the appropriate runtime environment.\nEnsure your environment variables (e.g., DATABASE_URL, KEY_SECRET) are set up in Render.\nDeploy and obtain the live API URL.\n\n\n\n\nSubmission Requirements\nStudents must submit:\n\nGitHub repository URL containing:\n\nImplemented middlewares/authMiddleware.js.\nUpdated protected routes using the middleware.\n.env file with KEY_SECRET (excluded from public repositories).\n\n\nScreenshots of API tests showing:\n\nSuccessful request with a valid token.\nError message when trying to access a protected route without a token.\nError message when using an invalid token.\n\n\nRender Deployment URL with the working backend.\n\n\nGrading Criteria\n\n\n\nCriteria\nWeightage\n\n\n\n\nJWT middleware implemented correctly\n25%\n\n\nRoutes properly secured using middleware\n25%\n\n\nAPI tests completed & documented\n25%\n\n\nBackend deployed on Render successfully\n25%"

Implement Authentication System. (2%)\n\n\nAdd a Login Form (/login) where users can authenticate.\n\n\nAdd a Register Form (/register) to allow new users to sign up.\n\n\nEnsure the authentication system communicates with the backend for user validation.\n\n\nStore JWT tokens securely in local storage.\n\n\n2. Secure Routes with Authentication (2%)\n\n\nProtect certain pages (e.g., adding or modifying movies) to be accessible only for authenticated users.\n\n\nRedirect unauthorized users to the login page.\n\n\nImplement a logout functionality that clears stored credentials and redirects to the login page.\n\n\n3. Enhance Forms with Foreign Key Selectors (1%)\n\n\nInstead of manually entering Movie IDs or Actor IDs, create dropdown selectors that fetch available movies or actors from the backend.\n\n\nApply this for:\n\n\nAssigning actors to a movie\n\n\nAdding earnings by selecting a movie\n\n\n\n\n4.
